## General Info
* The project contains two features. Using React Router, you can navigate between them using buttons on the top of the screen. 
* First feature - "Display Logo":
* After clicking on the button, on the screen appears the name and logo of a random Bundesliga football club. It uses API: https://www.football-data.org/ to download the data and displays it using GitHub Pages.
* Second feature - "When Does He Play?"
* On the screen appears the select option form. After choosing one player from this list, you will see when (date and time) this footballer plays his next game and the names of both teams.
* Link to the website: https://emil2301.github.io/football-app/
* I made this app, because every week I check on the internet when my favourite footballers play their matches. Now I can use this app and I have everything found for me. I made also the logo drawing feauture, because I wanted to use React Router to navigate between two Links.
